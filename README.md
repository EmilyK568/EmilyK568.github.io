# Wedding Organizer Project
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.0.

The project includes:
- [Ngrx](https://ngrx.io/guide/store)
- [D3](https://d3js.org/)
- [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)

This project is the proof of concept for a wedding planner organizer. It uses Angular Material for the component library and theme for the panels and inputs of the reactive forms used in the `Add a Guest` feature. After submitting the form, the data is then saved to the store for state management. Navigating to the `Guest List` feature, the data is pulled from the store to populate both the guest list table and the D3 bar chart.
